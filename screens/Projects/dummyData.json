                "description": "In the words of Mahatma Gandhi, �Literary Education is of no value if it is not able to build up a sound character.� Keeping the above thought in mind, The Neem School Project was initiated by NSS IITD in collaboration with the White Swan Foundation to ensure quality value education in slum children. We, as a part of the Neem school, visit slums near IITD and try to inculcate the values of honesty, integrity, kindness, helping- nature, cleanliness, hygiene and a lot more through fun filled activities like painting, story-telling, games, etc. The NSS volunteers, called the Value Initiators, interact with the Value Multipliers, i.e. children in age group of 6-14 years and aim at developing good moral character and conduct in the children.",
